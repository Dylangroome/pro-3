A HumanPlayer represents the human player. It is an extension of the BasePlayer class.
 
### TicTacToe
Stores the board,inputs and outcomes for the game tictactoe

### Game
Stores the options,inputs and outcomes for the game 🪨 📄 ✂️

- Random: used to randomize the computer's moves.
- Colorama: used to color code the text.


## Testing


### Validation Testing

I used pep8 (https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/#) to validate my python code.

run.py file

github validation.

If the line is too long just add 
```$python 
# noqa
```
There is a space before the # and after it to skip the quality assurance for that line.

### Manual Testing

Username 
1. Arrive on app page on Heroku.
2. Try to input a blank username.
3. Get error message.
4. Try to input a valid username.

Making a move
1. Try to type in anything other than the optional input.
2. Get an error message.
3. Try to type a valid option.
4. Verify the right game is displayed.
5. Verify that the number has been taken away from the ""Available Moves"" board.
6. Verify that the numbers that were input previously cannot be input again."
7. Verify the computer displays a option

Ended 
1. Select ""N"" to exit.
2. Check that the game exits the play loop.
3. Check that the game says goodbye.


- [ ] invalid entry, says try again  and repropts
- [ ] no entry, says try again and reprompts


### Defect Tracking

- games would run before asking username and greeting when main function was imported 

fix was to remove main function 
call from rock.py and tic.py

- Error when uppercase input 

fix was to add the .lower to inputs request

- not breaking 
 from a while 
 caused the game to continue 
 Infinity 

fix was to add a break to while loop
